## Assumptions

- Creating and maintaining vocabularies is a social enterprise
- Vocabularies constantly need to evolve
- There should be no central source of truth for vocabularies
- Vocabularies can be private

## Goals

This project is meant to experiment with using [Linked Open Vocabularies](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/) in a distributed way using Solid pods in order to facilitate work towards common goals while respecting the needs for differences in the meanings and use of common terms.  

This is partially inspired by [Skohub](https://skohub.io) and it use of ActivityPub, but extended to general OWL or RDFS ontologies or vocabularies and allowing them to evolve in a distributed way on Solid pods.

## Dependencies
